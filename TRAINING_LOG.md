# TRAINING_LOG.md — append-only record of every attempt

Times are PDT. One entry per attempt: target, trace, pre-registration, counters, gate numbers, decision,
lesson, next. Corrections are dated entries, never edits. The closed-directions ledger and the
functional-area map are at the end and are the only parts edited in place.

## Phase 0 (2026-09-30)

- Engine battlecode24 3.0.6 built from source (maven artefacts return 403); seed patch honoured
  (robot ids change with `-Dbc.game.seed`); determinism verified: the same seed twice gives identical
  per-round metrics.
- Replay reader `tools/replaydump/ReplayDump.java` with summary / `--every` / `--metrics` / `--from --to` /
  `--robot` / `--map-at` / `--logs` / `--bytecode` / `--navstats` / `--flags`; integrity-tested on a
  committed fixture replay (`tools/test_tools.py`).
- 2024 replays carry no robot stdout: counters go in indicator strings.
- Benchmarks: 73 repos with 2024 bots found and cloned (BENCHMARK.md); blind compile running.
- Compute VM `battlecode-dev` could not start: `ZONE_RESOURCE_POOL_EXHAUSTED` for e2-standard-8 in
  us-west1-b; retrying every 5 minutes.

## Iteration 0 — foundation bot (g_iter0)

Architecture (`src/bot`): `RobotPlayer` (turn loop, bytecode monitor, exception counter), `G` (per-robot
globals, xorshift rng from the id, rng tie-breaks), `C` (constants), `Comms` (shared-array schema),
`Nav` (greedy + bug with per-robot handedness, stall exit, fill water when stuck), `Micro` (kite and
strike on a dist² 10 threat radius, flag carriers then lowest HP), `Duck` (setup: crumbs then explore,
gather at the dam from r150; defenders 0-2 trap their flag; main: pick up / carry flags to the nearest
spawn tile, fight, heal, go to the nearest known enemy flag or broadcast hint; upgrades attack > heal >
capture).

Diagnostic (DefaultSmall, seed 7, vs examplefuncsplayer): **won by CAPTURE at r746**; first capture r436;
kills 424 / deaths 12; 248 stun traps built (35 hit by the enemy... enemy triggered 207 of ours);
bytecode max 13,981 of 25,000, 0 overruns, 0 exceptions; nav ABA oscillation 9.1% (example bot 15.9%).
Accepted by construction as the first rung.
