"""Shared ladder bookkeeping over progress/games.csv (one row per scrimmage, in play order).
Columns: run,seq,teamA,teamB,map,winner(A|B),rounds,reason,seed. Our team appears as 'us:<build>'.

Ratings are a batch Bradley-Terry fit over every game at once (2026-09-24, PROMPTS 15-16), on the Elo
scale (400 points = 10:1 odds), and each of our builds is its own player. The old sequential K=32 Elo,
with one 'us' rating inherited by every build, depended on play order: 96 easy calibration games lifted
'us' from rank 65 to rank 4, above bots with 104-9 records against us. The fit has no order, and a
build's rating comes only from its own games. A weak prior (one virtual win and one loss against a
1500 anchor) keeps unbeaten or winless records finite; the anchor fixes the scale at 1500."""
