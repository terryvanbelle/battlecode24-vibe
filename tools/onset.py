"""When does each metric start predicting the result?

    tools/onset.py <run-dir> [--threshold 0.30] [--metric ec]

Correlation with the outcome is computed at every sampled round, so a metric's
correlation becomes a curve rather than a number. The round where that curve
first crosses the threshold (and stays across the next sample) is its ONSET.

Why this matters: correlation cannot separate cause from symptom, but *temporal
precedence* is evidence. If coverage starts predicting the result at r100 and
EC count only at r250, coverage is upstream. Metrics are ranked by onset, so the
earliest riser is the first place to look for a lever.

Caveats printed with the output: with n games the noise floor on a correlation
is about 2/sqrt(n) (n=29 -> 0.37), so onsets from a small block are suggestive,
not conclusive; and a metric that is *constant* early (drones, net guns) cannot
have an early onset even if it matters later."""
